# Deploy code and models

In this section, learn how to deploy code and models into production environments that respond to changing compliance requirements and support best practices.

## Compliance foundations

### Set up infrastructure for compliance:

- [Governance](../azure/compliance/governance.md)
- [Landing Zone](../azure/Landingzone.md)
- [Setup Subscription](../azure/compliance/setup-subscription.md)

### Day 2 Operations

- [Log Analytics for Compliance](../azure/compliance/log-analytics.md)

## Deploy containers

- [Create local registry](createlocalregistry.md)
- [Deploy source code to image without a Dockerfile](./deploycontainerwithoutDockerfile.md)
- [Deploy the application using a Docker image in a local registry](./deploytolocalregistry.md)

### Deploy container to Azure

- [Create Azure container registry (CLI) [Azure]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-tutorial-prepare-acr)
- [Deploy container to App Services [Azure]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-custom-container?tabs=python&pivots=container-linux-vscode)
- [Setup AKS using ARM Templates](../azure/aks.md)
- [Setup AKS using Terraform](../azure/aks-terraform.md)

### Deploy container to OpenShift

- [Deploy the application using a GitHub repo with sources and a Dockerfile to OpenShift](./deploycontaineropenshift.md)
