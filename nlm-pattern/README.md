## Hugging Face

Hugging Face models come already pre-trained, which further simplifies the process of crushing into NLP. To put it simply, developers donâ€™t start from scratch anymore; they now simply load a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face hub, fine-tune it to their specific tasks, and start from there.
